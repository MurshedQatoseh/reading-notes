# Mongo and Mongoose

> When it comes to data, we need to store them inside a database , a place which contains data, depending on the type of data and the application we choose the type of database.

**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

SQL:
1. primarily called as relational database
2. have predefined schema
3.  table based database 
4.  not best fit for hirearchical data storage
5. vertically scalable whereas 
NoSql:
1. document based key value pairs
2. horizontally scalable
3. not good fit for complex queries 
4. have dynamic schema for unstructured data
5. can be categorized as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store databases, and XML databases based on how the data is stored.


**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

Ideal for demanding transactional applications.

**Give a real world example.**
Sales, purchases made by customers, and customer information.

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

Items that contain the key-pair value.

**Give a real world example.**

a location to keep the online shopping adverts.

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

Better for hierarchical storage is SQL.

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

NoSQL because it doesn't need hardware upgrades.

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language.

**What is a relational database?**

a database designed to identify connections between informational objects.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Data is arranged into rows and columns, which together make up a table in a relational database.

**What is a 'schema'?**

Is the database management system capable of supporting the formal language used to define the structure of a database. The word "schema" refers to the way that data is organized as a construction plan for the database.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

A place (database) that stores data in a form of key-value pair.

**How does it work?**

Instead than using relational tables, store data in documents.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Data records are kept in MongoDB as documents, specifically BSON documents, which are organized into collections.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB as it ensures high and diverse data availability

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

Don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
